# RestaurantFinder
Enter a meal item of your choice and view a list of restaurants near you with that item! 

This is an application created using SwiftUI for users to search for a meal/ food item of preference and view all locations in your vicinity that contain that item. This project was created as a way to learn about APIs and how to implement them.
